# Accident-Severity-Prediction-Model
I utilized driver impairment as an independent variable in my linear regression model to predict accident severity since it holds a significant potential for traffic accident analysis and prevention in underdeveloped countries.

This can be seen where the model predictions will serve as early warning system to public policy makers,law enforcement, and various stakeholders, helping them to make more informed decisions about how to reduce the number of traffic accidents. 

Additionally, this model can provide valuable insights about the effectiveness of different interventions such as; educational campaigns and enforcing stricter traffic regulations. 

By achieving the mentioned objectives, my model's prediction will help to reduce the number of traffic accidents and improve the safety of roads in these underdeveloped nations.
